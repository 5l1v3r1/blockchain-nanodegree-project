# Project #2. Private Blockchain

I find project 2 is somehow difficult because Javascript Promise is not easy to understand. The function you called may not update the value you want immediately, which means you should be very careful with the value it returned.

I also find this post very helpful:

It gives a general view of this project and also offers some practical advices.

Project 2 recommends students to use Promise in their functions. But, async/await sometimes could be easier to understand. You can checkout this post which is recommended by the reviewer:

And for the validation of the chain, remember to check the link between adjacent blocks.

For me, the reviewer's comment really helped a lot!
